Smart_Disc
==========

As part of a UM-Dearborn Senior Design Project that began in Fall 2013, Smart Disc is part web-app and part embedded system. With the goal of providing better performance analytics for disc golfers, a Lilypad Arduino powers an embedded system that records disc flight data to an SD card, the data can then be uploaded to smartdisc.org (web-app) in order to process and display the data in a useful manner.
